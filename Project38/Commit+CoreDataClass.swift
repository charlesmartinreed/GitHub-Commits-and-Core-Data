        //this is because a new entity object is created each time. This obvious scales poorly.
        //This is where NSFetchedResultsController comes in since it takes over the NSFetchedResults role to load data, using its own storage and keeps the UI in sync with changes to the data by controlling the way objects are inserted and deleted.
